# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful community for all participants. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within our community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating respect and empathy toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without their explicit consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They should take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include posting via an official social media account or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, you can report the behavior according to the following steps:

1. **Reach out to the person involved** and attempt to resolve the issue directly. If you feel uncomfortable addressing the issue directly, or if the behavior continues, proceed to the next step.
2. **Contact the project maintainers**. Provide a detailed report of the incident, including any relevant details about the behavior, and if possible, any witnesses.
3. **If the incident is particularly egregious**, or involves a threat to anyone's safety, skip the first step and contact the project maintainers immediately.

Project maintainers will then conduct an investigation and determine the appropriate corrective action, which may include the issuance of a warning, temporary suspension, or permanent expulsion from the community.
